In our last episode, we arrived at San Francisco in Explored Chinatown. There we found a brotherhood of steel outpost, and the brotherhood asked us to travel to the nearby enclave base called Navarro to retrieve some vertebrate plans for them. We also learned that Navarro is just a vertebrate refueling station, so it's likely not the place the enclave took our missing tribespeople. We need to head to Navarro to get these vertebrate plans, and see if we can find any clues that point to where the enclave took our people. Now the brotherhood told us that Navarro is heavily guarded. A frontal assault is likely not going to work. Instead, they recommended that we leave our companions at San Francisco and infiltrate Navarro by pretending to be an enclave recruit. And so wearing nothing but our vultzuit, we hop in the highway man and travel north until we find Navarro. As soon as we arrive, we get taken aside by a man in a purple robe. Howdy stranger, whoa baby, check out that set of wheels, he says. It's in one of those in years. What can all Chris do for you? What is this place we can ask? This here's my place, Chris's. It's a service station. Ain't you ever seen one of those in old magazines and such? That's what I've got here, a service station. Oh while I'm looking for Navarro, is this it we can ask? Navarro says Chris, ain't heard of that name in ages. Old military base southeast of San Fran, and that's a way south of here. But we know this guy is lying. We just recently came from the military base and it wasn't called Navarro. So the chosen one can say, I've been there and that's not Navarro. Huh? Says Chris? Uh, well sure it is. I heard tell of it a while back. Navarro military base southeast of San Francisco. The chosen one can say you lie. I don't have the patience for this. Tell me the truth or you'll be sorry. Scroo you says Chris and he takes a radio out of his robe. You wanna see a sorry? I got some boys who will show you a whole new meaning for the word. And he starts to turn the radio on. We have a brief moment to react here. If we say, hey, what do you think you're doing? Chris speaks into the radio. Alert, we've got an intruder at the station. Alert! With that Chris turns hostile. Die outside or he says and he attacks. Now Chris isn't very difficult to defeat. But he's alerted the enclave at Navarro. Now if we show up everyone will turn hostile. Our plan to masquerade is an enclaver of croot is foiled. Alternatively once he pulls out his radio we can say, that's a bad move partner. This gives us a brief moment to kill him before he radios the enclave. We may not have been able to fool Chris but at least the enclave don't know we're here. Alternatively if we try to run by saying, hey, I'm out of here. He again alerts the enclave. So our only option after mentioning the military base is to kill him outright. But there are many more speech options here with Chris. Instead of asking about Navarro we can say, have you seen any vertebirds fly through here? And Chris says, vertebirds? That's an interesting subject. Now why would you be asking about them here? And we can say, well the shaman of my tribe told me these vertebirds stole our people. I'm here to find them. Shaman says Chris. Look here. If your shaman says he sees things flying around and scooping up people then he's been stiff in too many herbs. Got it? Well we can say, Hakuunan was a great shaman. If he says he saw vertebirds then he has saw them. And Chris says, well nice talking with you. Here's some advice though. Ain't nothing in these parts except wasteland and radiation. Civilization south of here. I'd be heading that way if I was you. Thanks we can say. Or if we say, I'm just looking around. He says, well, I don't mean to be rude or nothing but this here is private property. If you're going to be poking around somewhere, don't be doing it here. After choosing either of these two options we can explore a bit but Chris stays nearby and he watches everything we do. However, if we ask him about the vertebirds after having talked with the brotherhood of Stilett San Francisco we find another option here to say, well I'm asking about them because I know some people who are interested in the vertebirds. I'm trying to locate them for them. Well that doesn't mean anything to me says Chris but in case I see one of these vertebirds, whom should I be telling? Oh we can say, well you can tell the brotherhood of Stil. The brotherhood says Chris, uh yeah well I'll do just that. I mean well I got things to do but the chosen one notices his hesitation. Wait a minute pal says the chosen one. Obviously I've got some powerful friends and they tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy. Uh hey says Chris, I'm just told to shine off visitors and such. I don't want the kind of trouble you're talking. Then I would suggest you tell me the best way into the base. Now we can say and Chris says, well I suppose that would be through the trap door on the floor of my room. Just go and leave me be. All right we can say I'll do just that. But then Chris walks off and the chosen one notices something. He's pulling out a radio. He's going to alert the whole base we say I've got to deal with him quickly and before Chris can make it to his hut we can kill him. If we killed him fast enough we killed Chris before he could warn the base and we gain 500 experience. But if we arrive here at Navarro after having talked with the brotherhood of Stil at San Francisco we can try to use the plan they suggested which is to impersonate an enclave recruit. To do so we find an option after Chris stops us to say, hey have you ever heard of the enclave are they around here and Chris says enclave that a group or something that don't ring no chimes with me. But uh what do you want with him and we can say oh well I want to join. Join up he says you're a tribal what makes you think they'd want a tribal and his posse no less. Now I read that he is not supposed to mention the posse if we came here by ourselves but this is a bug he mentions them anyway because the car counts as a companion in terms of this dialogue check. So this is a scripting error in order to convince him with our highway man here even if we're otherwise alone we have to pass a speech check to do so we can say I'm serious I'm looking to join the enclave. Wait a minute says Chris are you trying to say that you're one of the enclave replacements? If that's the case then why aren't you alone and again due to this bug we have to pass another speech check to proceed we can say well I hired an escort and if we pass it he says damn sorry for the hassle I'm supposed to clear a bunch of newbies coming through here but I got to weed out the trash. Anyway just go up to the gate through the woods there and give them the password it's sheep's head oh and stay on the path thanks we can say and with that Chris lets us buy now we can explore his little service station here heading through the door we see a room to the right that leads to the garage all the containers here are empty moving out of the service station we find a shack attached this must be where Chris sleeps if we try to access the door Chris stops us and tells us not to nose around in order to get in here we've got to kill Chris and here we find the hatch on the ground that Chris told us about heading down we find a back passage that leads to Navarro it's a long hallway or if we convinced him that we're a new enclave recruit we can follow the path through the woods towards the gate like he suggested now there is a third and final way to get into Navarro from here but we'll talk about it in just a minute following the trail through the trees we find an exit grid to the northwest on the other side we find Navarro and we can talk to the guards oh this is federal property now it mittens without proper authorization oh well I have my pass it was right here don't give me any excuses you need to either show me your pass or give me the password I'm sorry I lost my pass and I don't know anything about a password I suggest you leave this installation immediately and do not return here without proper authorization do I make myself clear but yes sir if we try again oh back again but you'd better have your pass or know your password this time well I'm waiting oh to hell with it bite the bullet jerk he and the other enclave here turn hostile this is pretty tricky because not only do we have to kill these enclave but we have to destroy the guard turrets just outside so instead when he confronts us we can say I'm a new recruit I was told you'd be expecting me I see may I have your password and if we got it from Chris we can say the sheep's head one moment okay you check out report to the drill chief go through the gate pass the canal it's the first door on the right okay we find a couple of computers in the guard post but they're not active heading through the gate we see the dog kennel just off to the right that must mean the drill chief is in the adjoining room opening the door we find him standing against a wall now if we infiltrated the base without posing as an enclave recruit he says welcome to camp tomorrow a civilian how in the hell did this a million get on this base I'll have someone to ask for dinner get this a million off government property if we try again well I'll be damned I had the bunch of you escorted off this base and here you are again I don't think you're civilians after all more than likely your spies sound the alarm and execute these maggots he attacks but if we successfully convinced Chris that we're a new enclave recruit he says welcome to camp noveiro so you're the new replacement you are out of uniform soldier where is your power armor it just so happens that you're wearing it I'll just take it off your dead body bad that wasn't smart they all turn hostile so instead we can say uh I wasn't issued any armor don't have any you expect me to believe that maggot the truth is you lost an expensive piece of army issue equipment that suit is gonna come out of your pay and you will remain in this man's army until you are five hundred and ten years old which is the number of years it will take for you to pay for a mark two power combat armor you have lost report to the army and have a new suit issued to you report back to me private dismissed yes sergeant if we talk to him again soldier you are still out of uniform I gave you a direct order to report to supplies and get your issue now get out of my face and don't get back to you look like a soldier yes sergeant I'm on my way or instead of saying we weren't issued any we can say the base didn't issue me any they said it would be issued here those papers shuffling jackass how the hell do they expect me to run this unit if they keep short-changing me unsupplies double time it over the army and get your issue and report back to me yes sergeant okay this sergeant dorn and is quite a character looks like we better find that power armor before talking with him again the containers and dorn and room are all empty there's a room to the north where we find a couple of scientists but they don't say much to us since we're still out of uniform all they do is tell us to get in uniform and that's the story with everyone here until we're wearing power armor so before we can proceed with the story we really got to get this armor we see a freight elevator here but we'll explore it in a minute moving across the road we can enter the building to the west we see a bunch of tables this must be where the enclave eat and we find a kitchen to the south here we find a man son he says I can tell from the smell that you're not wearing one of them powered armor suits if the serge sees you out of uniform you're screwed and I ain't talking the type of screwing that feels good now get your ass down to supply and suit up where's that we can ask and he says take the elevator in the next room down follow the hall to the main junction turn left and it's the first door on your left off you go thanks we can say the tables and shelves in this room are empty as are the nearby barracks so we can take the freight elevator down to the first floor we arrive in a long hallway heading all the way to the end we arrive at a crossroads with yet another freight elevator this one leads us to a computer room with a scientist we'll make good use of this later so going back down we can try to find this armory turning right we see a guard in front of a door you must be looking for the armory he says go back down the hall turn right and it's the first door on the left you'll get your issue there thanks we can say going down the hall we find another elevator and we see a door to the right this door leads to a long hallway which ends at a ladder going up which brings us to Chris's shack so this is the back passage we would have arrived at had we come in this way but this is not the armory so back down the ladder and retracing our steps we can cross the hall to enter another room here we find the quarter master I'm busy right now come back I came back later but I never got him to say much of anything else there's nothing in his desk but moving it to the room beyond this we find a number of lockers in one we find a plasma rifle in the next we find a 10 millimeter SMG 10 millimeter ammunition and small energy sounds in the next one we find a suit of advanced power armor this is the issue that Sergeant Dornan sent us to retrieve wearing this we now appear as any other enclave soldier this is the best suit of armor in the game it has a DR of 55 and a DT of 15 it grants plus four to strength and plus 60 to radiation resistance this means we can give the T51B to one of our companions the locker next to this is empty but next to this we find some microfusion cells energy cells buff out shotgun shells in the combat shotgun next to this we find a blue memory module another strange item we don't know what to do with yet so we'll keep it for now and in the final locker we find some explosives now that we're dressed in our power armor the enclave treat us as one of them moving back to the hallway we can take the elevator at the end of the hall this leads us to a small room by a satellite dish we'll explore this way later heading back downstairs we can go down the southern hallway at the end we find a room to the right here we see a big computer and a scientist standing outside yes soldier he says when is this place we can ask this is the computer room that's the mainframe over there the interface terminal is next to it and these devices are the holotape data storage units this is the latest and the greatest so what do you do here we can ask i'm the senior computer analyst he says i get to maintain all of the equipment here say we can say can i use the system for a minute you know check it out this is a speech check and if we pass it he says well i'm not supposed to allow anyone other than trained personnel to use the equipment it's all rather complex and delicate you understand well i promise not to break it we can say and he says all right you can access the system from the terminal over there just be careful please they'll shoot us both if you damage that machine oh and the guest password is snooki snooki we can say what the hell is the snooki snooki he says it's my girlfriend's nickname i think it's cute that's her out in the hall by the way she's one of the guards yeah says the chosen one cute thanks now that we have the password we can access the terminal please enter your password it says we can try to hack into the system and if we fail the computer says unauthorized activity detected in main computer complex security alert security alert crap says the chosen one we set off the alarm and everyone turns hostile however if we pass the hack we find an option to initiate the welcome program alternatively of course we can enter the password we learned snooki welcome to the on-clam says the terminal you have limited system privileges at this time for use of use this system has been equipped with a common english parser please enter all requests as english sentences where are the vertebrae plans located we can ask searching access and current inventory records data acquired current records indicate that one set of vertebrae schematics are in stock four copies of the vertebrae schematics have been ordered a squirter four copies of the vertebrae schematics have been delivered the squirter three copies of the vertebrae schematics have been reported lost the squirter the vertebrae schematics are housed in maintenance fine says the chosen one so where is maintenance located searching accessing base architectural files data acquired maintenance is located above ground and the northeast quadrant of the base thanks we can say so where is the enclave main base located we can ask searching accessing geographical maps data acquired enclave headquarters is located 175 miles up the coast of california in the pacific ocean coordinates are 37 degrees 18 minutes north latitude by 128 degrees seven minutes west launch it to what the hell does all that crap mean says the chosen one searching accessing english slang dictionary data acquired translation follows one it's a long ways away out in the ocean two it's off the coast of california three it's west of the city of San Francisco four if you do not understand the geographical coordinate system then you will not find it how can i get there we can ask searching accessing transportation directory data acquired transportation files indicate that 1,257 methods can be used to reach the enclave headquarters however records also indicate that only two of these methods are currently available vertebrae transportation can be acquired at nivaro outpost ship transportation can be acquired at San Francisco harbor please note that ship transportation has been flagged as inaccessible due to security act 9-837-334-27a ship has been disabled and a pasky is required for reactivation base commander nivaro outpost currently holds the pasky got it we can say we can ask where the armory is but we've already alluded it so finally we can say where is the base commander's office located searching accessing base architectural files data acquired base commanders office is located below ground in the northeast quadrant of the base sounds good we can say thank you for accessing unclave net logging off so the main unclave base is located in the pacific ocean now the computer said we could take a vertebrae there but that option was ultimately cut from the game there is now only one way to get there and that's to find a ship in San Francisco to take us there but first we have to find a key to reactivate that ship which is being held by the base commander adding out of the computer room we see that guard standing in the hallway that the scientist told us about why are you looking at me like that soldier she says i hear you're called snooki we can say i think that's cute what he told you that when i get off duty i'm gonna kick his ass move along soldier and wipe that smirk off your face okay we can say moving across the hallway we open a door to enter another lab with the desk here if we try to open it the scientist stops us stay away from there he says i hope you have a good reason for interrupting my work soldier he says well i wanted to ask you some questions we can say it is as very well i have to live with you grunts so i might as well make an effort to get along with you who are you we can ask my name is shrieber doctor shrieber i'm the base physician among other things don't bother with your name soldier all the grunts look the same in that armor of yours well what do you do here we can ask i work as the base physician but that's just a sideline actually i'm a geneticist what's a geneticist we can ask i really don't think you have the intellectual capacity to understand my work soldier he says let's just say that i can customize people or animals well what is this place we can ask and he says this was the base med lab however i felt that my experiments took precedence over the minimal medical needs of the soldiers here so i had it converted into a lab now apparently we see thick puffy walls and sound baffles on the walls for we find an option here to say why is this room soundproofed and shrieber says in the course of my research i perform experiments on test subjects sometimes they get a little vocal the base commander found this to be disturbing so he had the sound proofing installed now while we were on our way over here we heard the sound of heavy footsteps in the room below this led us to conclude that a death claw must have been there which is why we find an option here to say why is there a death claw in the other room and shrieber says big brown and ugly it's an experiment that i've recently completed it's scheduled for termination why are you going to kill it we can ask and he says the enclave has been looking for cheap expendable soldiers we are interested in death clans because they have built in armor and weapons and they're mean as hell they just need to be smarter so they can understand commands but not too smart or they could develop a will of their own with me so far yes i follow you we can say well he continues we succeeded we actually managed to increase their intelligence however i began to suspect that we went too far that maybe they were a lot smarter than they were letting on so when i was transferred here i brought one of them with me so i could put my theory to the test and we can say i was right he says the death clans have apparently been playing dumb by adding their time and trying to learn as much as they can from us they can even mimic human speech i've actually had a conversation with that fellow in the next room anyway the fact that they were capable of conceiving this plan and pulling off the deception shows just how dangerous they are so what do you plan to do now we can ask and he says i'm going to write a report on my findings and have it transmitted to the enclave of course i'll have to recommend the extermination of the death claw breed they are much too dangerous a threat and if we're feeling devilish we can say hey can i kill the death clon for you and he says be my guest it's in the next room finally in the corner of the room we see what appears to be a stuffed dog we can ask him about this hey doctor shrieber what's with the dog statue by the door that's k9 my dog he says i decided to see if i could cyber enhance his intelligence it worked but he developed a bad case of morals he decided that he didn't like my work or me very much and he bit me as punishment i disabled his legs but left him pretty much functional otherwise now he gets to sit there and watch every distasteful thing i do can he be fixed we can ask oh yes he says i removed his motivator circuit and gave it to Raouel up in maintenance it could always be put back in maybe i'll do that someday just to see if he's changed his attitude the containers in this room are empty so heading out we can go down the hallway and open the door to the south as we do snookie takes us aside sorry soldier she says that area is off limits to base personnel i have to ask you to leave but if we got permission from the doctor to take care of the death claw on the other side of the store we find an option to say doc wants me to kill the critter for him he doesn't want to do it himself and she says i knew that bastard wouldn't have the balls to do it himself oh no it's okay if one of us gets screwed up oh well go on and good luck soldier thanks snookie we can say opening the door we find a death claw greetings human i am the warrior zarn are you to be my executioner i don't know we can say i'd like to know why you're here and zarn stairs at us intently for a moment very well the enclave created my people as a slave warrior race they enhanced our intellect hoping we could better understand their commands and yet not recognize our status as slaves they failed we are much more intelligent than they suspect we decided to play the fool until we could gain our freedom our chance arrived when the enclave decided to test us outside their control here on the mainland doctor shrieber opposed their decision but he was overruled not accepting the enclave decision he chose exile to this base captured me at has been performing experiments to determine my true nature he has been successful when he reports his findings to the enclave my people will be hunted down in slain i must escape and warn my people oh no and we know that his people are already dead and we realized that had we gotten here sooner and killed dr shrieber before he alerted the enclave we could have saved them preventing their attack but we didn't how could we have known but we don't find an option to tell zarn here the fate of his tribe instead we can say if this guy is such a threat then why didn't you just kill him recently i began to consider just such an action even though it is not my way to kill i am certain the doctor noticed because he stopped seeing me in person the choice is no longer mine to make thanks for the story we can say it was interesting now if when we met zarn we instead said yes i am your executioner he says so be it i do not intend to go quietly human let us make this a battle to remember i am ready we can say let's party and with that zarn attacks i am going to tear off your limbs and beat you with them he's a tough death flaw but in our new enclave power armor has a tax doom minimal damage when he is dead we can go back to shrieber but he has nothing to say about the death of zarn no thank you or anything or instead of killing him when he asks us if we are his executioner instead we can say no i'm here to rescue you i find it hard to believe that an enclave soldier is here to rescue me more likely you are here to build up my hopes so that you can dash them to pieces no look i really am here to rescue you you are my last hope so i will place my trust in you that door over there leads to an air shaft that exits into the woods above i should be able to climb the shaft and gain my freedom however the door is securely locked and requires a pasky to open find the key unlock the door and grant me my freedom sure we can say i'll do it and now we know why shrieber was so conscious about the drawers to his desk heading back into the doctor's office we can talk to him back again he says what can i do for you this time are you sure this room is soundproofed we can ask of course i'm sure he says the commander would have a fit otherwise why well we can say i don't want anyone to hear your screams as i experiment on you and what that doctor shrieber flees but he doesn't flee far enough with shrieber dead we can try to talk with his dog the life functions of my master have terminated he says are you my new master ha we can say a talking dog one says canine i am a dog two i am communicating with you vocally using the common english language therefore it is safe to assume that i am a talking dog now do you intend to answer the question that i posed to you a moment ago yes we can say are you my master he repeats and we can say sounds good excellent says canine i am in need of repairs master my motivation unit has been removed find it replace it and i will join you any idea where i can find this part we can ask and he says i am not sure master i would try maintenance it is upstairs in the northeast corner of the base i'll try there we can say if i don't find it i'll look around for it we don't find anything on doctor shrieber's body then opening his desk we find a blue pass key heading out of the lab we can go back to zarn hello again have you found the key to the door yeah i've got it i'll open the door for you we can say thank you i will not forget this you're welcome then moving south we can use the blue card key to open the door thank you again my friend i owe you a dead that cannot be repaired with that zarn leaves the room and walks down a long hallway the very end he climbs a ladder now this is not the only way to save zarn remember at the beginning of the episode i said there was a third way we could sneak inside this base well if instead of following the trail through the woods to the northeast we walked west we eventually find an air vent near to some rocks with a waterfall accessing it we can climb inside the base we go down a long hallway and arrive at zarn's door now to open this door we do have to have the blue pass key but thankfully doctor shrieber's desk is not the only place we can find one we actually already have this pass key we found it inside the gecko power plant if we have it with us we can simply use it on zarn's door and he walks out to his freedom alternatively if we didn't kill chris fast enough and he ended up radiating the enclave and tripping the alarm when we clamber down here to zarn he says greetings human the bases on full alert are you by any chance the cause yes we can say who are you i am zarn pack warrior allow me to join you and fight at your side for our freedom together we stand a chance alone who knows fine we can say we are in this together load up your claws and let's party down i think you human let us kick some enclave ass pack cruiser and what that zarn joins us as a temporary companion if we choose to assault the base head on zarn will fight for us but even with his help it's a difficult fight after frame or killing zarn we now have to find the base commander to get the activation key for the ship in san francisco heading out of the hallway we can turn right and again talk to the guard at the end of the hall sir what is your business here he says hi i'm new here we can say in the guard says quietly you must be lost then this is the base commander's office nobody's allowed in here unless the old man sends for you nobody sees him we can ask and he again responds quietly nobody well just the cleaning crew they usually come by in an hour or so other than that this place is off limits now you better head on out okay we can say now if we're stupid we can talk to him again and this time when he asks us why we're here we can say oh i'm here to clean the commander's office and he says yeah right i tell you the cleaning crew is coming and then you magically just become one of them you haven't even left my sight you think i'm a fricking moron get out of here so that didn't work if we try to access the door anyway the guard says secure all stations we're on alert and he attacks so instead we'll try to be a bit more crafty moving down it to the hallway we can wait an hour then when done head back he's not gonna recognize us behind this helmet this time would we say that we're here to clean the commander's office the guard turns to the door commander cleaning detail is here sir yes sir and then he looks at us go on in heading inside we find the commander standing by a table mega quick soldier i don't have all data stand around yes sir we can say instead of cleaning we can inspect his the second book shelf is empty but the first one has a big book of science at a copy of guns and bullets if we try to access his locker and the base commander catches us leave my locker alone he says or i will dish out some serious pain we could ignore his warnings in which case he attacks killing him is certainly one way to gain access to this locker or if our sneak skill is high enough we can sneak first then pick the locker inside we find a deck of tragic the gathering cards and a tanker phob this must mean that the oil tanker that we heard about in San Francisco is the ship we need to find the enclave in the second locker we find a plasma pistol at a stack of small energy cells then moving into the base commander's bedroom we can loot his containers but annoyingly they're all empty now there is another way to do this but it involves having a conversation first if we retrace our steps and go back the way we came in we arrive back at the enclave's canteen we can then go into the kitchen and talk to the chef who now that we're dressed like the enclave is willing to talk with us hey soldier you're looking for some grub or just someone to talk to oh let's chat a while we can say what you want to talk about he says what's going on around here we can ask looking for some gossip he says i could give you the latest on what's happening in maintenance the meb lab or among the grunts well what's going on in maintenance we can ask and he says Raoul the vertebrate mechanic doesn't like Quincy the head of maintenance those two are always getting into it i don't think it's a case of professional rivalry either anyway Raoul's an arrogant ass but Quincy's an okay kind of guy i hope he wins in the end well we can say what can you tell me about the meb lab and he says meb lab has been taken over by an enclave egghead named shrieber mean son of a gun don't care for nothing or nobody he's been doing some sort of experiments on death clause down there don't know what though anyway he was making all kinds of noise until the commander ordered the room soundproofed information we already know and took advantage of what can you tell me about the grunts we can ask ha we're talking romance my friend it seems one of the computer geeks has fallen for one of the grunts the guard outside the meb lab even has one of those cute scene names for her calls her snookie of all things anything else happening we can ask now that's it around this place he says if i hear anything more i'll let you know i like talking about it just as much as i like hearing it hey i'm interested in the vertebrates we can say if i wanted to look at the plans where could i find them and he says why you interested in those oh well no matter Quincy keeps them over in maintenance i think where's that we can ask a northeast corner of the base friend he says can't miss it where's the enclave main base located we can ask and he says i'm surprised you don't know you must be local i guess anyway main bases in the middle of the dag on ocean well not smack ass in the middle but it might as well be the only way to get there is by ship or vertebrate and the damn ship requires a reactivation phob phob we can ask and he says yeah a pasquay commander keeps it in his office without it she can't access some areas on the ship and that keeps the locals down in sand fran from paying an unwelcome visit so where is this commander's office we can ask and he says take the elevator in the next room down follow the hallway to the main junction and go straight if we got the information about the phob from this cook guy instead of pretending to be a cleaning crew we can go back down and try to bluff our way in when he asks us to leave we can say oh well i have business with the commander what is the nature of your business sir he asks us and once we have this information from the cook we find an option to say uh we got a call from base security seems they're worried about the tanker pasquay getting into the wrong hands we're here to lock it up this is a difficult speech check if we fail it he says let me see your orders and we can say oh i uh i didn't bring them with me and he says then get back to comm center and have them print the order but there is no option to have these orders printed in the game we've got to pass this check if we do the guard addresses the commander commander security detail is here main base wants the tanker pasquay secured yes sir and then he looks at us go on in with that we can enter the commander's office talking to him the phob is in the locker over there he says have the duty officer contact me once it's secured dismissed yes sir we can say now we can access the locker and take the phob without having to sneak and without him turning hostile now that we've done everything below ground we can retrace our steps and take the elevator back above ground remember sergeant dornin told us to report back to him once we got our issue now we've got it heading back to sergeant dornin we can check in with him excellent you're in uniform now so i'm going to give you a rare opportunity we are going to start over as if i never met your sorry ass would you like that soldier yes sergeant welcome to camp no more so you're the replacement what's your name private i'm oxhorn what was that did you forget something maggot my my name is oxhorn sir i am not a sir i work for a living you more on you will call me sergeant or sergeant dornin do you understand me sure serge whatever if i like you you can call me serge but guess what i don't like you do you understand yes sergeant outstanding proceed on the double to the hanger where you will stand guard duty you will do a fine job do you understand what am i guarding their sergeant you are on you're not to question my orders when i say jump you jump when i say fight you fight when i tell you to die for your country then you will certainly die have my babies of clia yes sergeant now this conversation is a bit different if we have a stupid chosen one when he asks us what our name is we say oh me oxhorn oh lovely they've sent me a moron listen closely you will stand guard at the hanger this is your duty post you will go there now and stay on guard until told otherwise now move it soldier me go oh that dornin man he's got to be so mean at any rate we appear outside the vertabird hanger uh we're on guard duty that we can ignore this if we want but if we do we find sergeant dornin walking around and if he catches us what are you doing here get back here guard post we appear back at the hanger oh great sergeant dornin is now doing a loop of the entire facility he checks in on every soldier but they don't really like him much good you found your duty station he says as whole they say if we stayed in one place when he gets to us stay awake stay alert stay alive and he keeps on walking however if we're not here when he arrives he stops in his tracks and says where the hell is that screw up private before marched enough what a brownie hound says the other enclave officers stay at your post until you're relieved soldier yeah you'd better walk away if we leave our post again and he catches us a second time moron if I see you away from your post again it will be the sorryest day of your short life and we appear back at our post if we leave our post and he catches us a third time you are a danger to us all that will end now he and all of the enclave here in Navarro attack sergeant dornin here is such a memorable figure that enclave soldiers remember serving under him for the rest of their lives the courier learns this when meeting cannibal johnson a former enclave soldier during the events of fallout new vegas there's a twitch in my trigger finger i've lost my eagle eyes and the other day i could have sworn i heard sergeant dornin chewing me out who's sergeant dornin he was a drill instructor i knew he was also the meanest bastard i've ever known once he caught this private out of uniform an old dornin went off on the most ear blistering rant known to man it was inspiring looks like it would have been a better idea had we got the power armor and then not gone back to dornin well now that he's on patrol we're gonna have to avoid him we find ourselves at the northwestern corner of navarro in the vertebrae finger which is lucky maybe we can find some vertebrae glands heading inside we find rawhu manning his post sorry man he says but i don't have time to chit chat you know i gotta get this bird working the dog wants to fix his dog we can say he sent me for the parts hey man it's in the locker over there he says take it until the duck rawhu says hi heading to the lockers we can explore the workbench first in the bottom one we find microphusion cells and small energy cells the top one is empty and the locker has k9s motivator the workbench in the middle has a dean's electronics a tool on a sledgehammer the top one is empty and the locker has a cat's paw magazine a leather jacket and an issue of guns and bullets the final workbench has an expanded lock pick set nice didn't have one of these before some junk and a motor these last two items are worthless the pegboard is empty and the locker is empty so no vertebrae plans here let's see where's arched dornin there he is going on his rounds i think we can sneak on by we'll see a door in the side of the building here heading out that way we see the small square building with the elevator inside that we saw earlier nice we can use this to get below and if they dornin back underground we can head to the doctor's lab and bring the motivator to k9 hello master says k9 have you found my motivator unit got it right here we can say then please install the part master please master okay calm down we can say using the k9 motivator part in our inventory on k9 i appear to be fully functional now master shall i join you k9 joins our party as a companion and we earn 3500 experience k9's name is of course not only just a pun because k9 is a k9 but it's also a reference to doctor who first appearing in this series in 1977 joining the fourth doctor as a companion even simple one-dimensional chest exposes the limitations of the machine mine bishop to queen six there affirmative check master what machine-mind computer mate in six nerves rubbish i think you and i should take a w a l k w a l k we're at look look is my no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no please for it i'm sorry k9 we won't be long k9 is a mediocre companion at max level his only stat to camp out at 10 is perception and the most tick points he'll ever get is 137 compare that to goris whose max hp is 187 and at his final level has 10 strength endurance and agility but k9 is superior to the cybernetic dog that we got as a companion from dock Henry and nc r so while not the best companion of the available dog companions he is one of the best there is however one other dog companion we can't get in fall out too who's better than k9 but we won't be talking about him for quite some time now i didn't want to get in trouble having this guy hang around the last thing i need is dorken to see me walking around with the doctor's dog so heading south we can take zarn's escape tunnel and climb out the air vent to arrive just outside the gas station then heading to the highway man we can lighten our load a bit throw our junk in the trunk and have k9 wait here by the car then i headed back to the air vent down to the escape tunnel and all the way back to the elevator to take it back top side now that we're top side we can see where dorken is where is he oh there he is looks like he just missed us nearby we see a large satellite dish next to a turret but we can't interact with it in any way after dorken and walk soft a bit we can move south and enter the big rectangular building next to one of the vertebrae birds shouldn't you be at your post soldier it's not good to wander about here says one guard sick we'll have to make it quick we can try accessing all of these computers but it's not worth our time we can't interact with any of them we can however talk with the nearby scientist yes soldier he says i'm new here we can say and i'm trying to get familiar with the base can i ask you some questions sure i've got a few minutes he says what is this place we can say this is air traffic control from here we can track all vertebrae movement well what's your job here we can ask i'm a computer technician he says first class i maintain the link to the mainframe below i need to look at the vertebrae plans we can ask where are they kept vertebrae plans he says i don't see why you would need to know that i suggest you talk to maintenance next door got it we can say access in the elevator here we can take it to the floor below and we see that it puts us out in the middle of the lower base just outside the base commander's office so heading back up uh-oh we see dorn and walking around outside we'll just wait here till he passes by okay and we're safe after he leaves the nearby maintenance room we can head out the front door and race inside here we find a ruined tanker of some sort there are a couple of tables here hidden behind a wall but they're both empty talking to the man standing here he says Quincy is in charge here go see him before we do we can open a door to a nearby room inside we find two desks both are empty so head and out we can talk to the man standing by the workbenches names Quincy soldier he says why are you tapping my shoulder and looking lost hi we can say i need to ask you something all right he says but make it quick i have inventory to do what is this place we can ask this is maintenance we repair pretty much anything except for the vertebirds well where do the vertebirds get repaired we can ask may only fit in the hanger or outdoors you figure it out from there okay he says i'm looking for vertebird plans we can ask do you know where i can find them well he says i've got a copy of the plans but i just can't hand them out to anyone who asks for them what do you want with them we can be very honest here and say oh well i've got some friends down south who want to get their hands on them and he says down south holy crap we've got a spy guards alert oops we can say put my foot in it this time he and everyone else turns hostile so instead of admitting that we are working for the brotherhood of steel we can say oh well i was told by the serge to get them and Quincy says look Einstein i can't give you the plans without authorization okay so go back to whoever sent you here and get the proper paperwork instead of shooting him in the head we can say hey you got it we see a number of containers behind him in the first locker we find a suit a combat armor we'll snag it in case everyone to get some dermal implant upgrades the workbench has a first aid manual and a laser pistol inside the pegboard is empty and when we try to access the locker next to him he says hey don't be rummaging through those drawers oh i think we know what's in here activating sneak mode and opening the locker sure enough we find the vertebrae plans in the workbench next to this we find a big book of science a super sledge a wrench and an electronic lock pick the pegboard is empty and then we can loot two foot lockers on the ground the first has some grenades in a crowbar and the second is empty now this was easy for me because i had pretty decent sneak but without sneak this becomes a tad more difficult he asked for permission before he'd hand over the vertebrae plans here's how we can get that permission heading south and trying to avoid dornan we can enter that one room right next to his office with the scientists inside these are the guys who wouldn't talk with us earlier because we weren't wearing the power armor yes sir says one of the scientists i'm new here we can say i need to ask a few questions to familiarize myself with the base i'm a new recruit myself sir he says i don't know if i can answer on your questions but i'll try what is this place we can ask this is the comm center he says we handle all communication with the main base from here what is your job here we can ask and he says i'm a comm center technician second class i handle all communications with the main base and i maintain equipment status where is the enclave main base located we can ask you've got to be kidding right he says do i look like i'm kidding we can respond and he says the main base is located off the Pacific coast near the city of San Francisco may i ask why you are asking and we can say no this is a military matter now how many ways do you know to reach the base and he says well there is the vertebrae but that's pretty obvious then there's the tanker San Fran other than that i guess you'd have to swim next we can say i need to look at the vertebrae plans where are they kept and he says when they would be located in maintenance next to air traffic control now even though he doesn't explicitly give us permission here this is the conversation we need to have but before we go back to maintenance we can head down this elevator we just arrive in a computer room the communications room there's nothing here a couple of generators we can't interact with a bunch of computers we can't interact with and scientists who don't say much so heading back top sign we can move back to maintenance and again check in with Quincy so your back he says did you get the authorization and we can say i was told by a tech that i could find the vertebrae plans here and he says a tech told you you mean Raoul did he send you and recalling our conversation with the cook earlier that Quincy and Raoul were at each other's throats we can say yeah Raoul that's the guy and Quincy says damn it you know Raoul would lose his head if it weren't placed so firmly up his ass this is the third time this quarter that he's lost those plans and now he doesn't even have the brass bouncing balls to come to me and ask for them fine they're in the locker over there oh and when you deliver them tell that asshole i want to see him thanks we can say and with that we now have permission to open the locker and take the plans but hey i want to see how this comedy plans out heading back to the hanger we can deliver Quincy's message to Raoul we find a new option here to say hey Raoul Quincy wants to see you Quincy huh he says well Raoul don't want to see him man Raoul is tired of his crap you know we could leave it at that or we can say Quincy said you were an asshole and that you wouldn't have the balls to report to him hey man he says Raoul don't take no crap from nobody you see Quincy working on these birds no way man only Raoul works on these babies you know why because Quincy don't know dick man that's why well we can say hey sorry man Raoul shouldn't be yelling at you you know it's not your fault you're just the messenger hey man you're busy right now not really we can say why hey look man says Raoul Raoul is gonna go pay Quincy a visit you know Raoul is gonna go clean the old man's clock you stay here and watch Raoul's birds okay sure Raoul we can say I'll do it for you but not just anybody hey thanks man says Raoul Raoul Ozu one don't go away and hey man if anyone screws with Raoul's birds you shoot them in the ass okay okay we can say with that Raoul marches off to confront Quincy I believe that we may have needed to go through this to gain access to the vertebrae to take it to the enclave base in the Pacific Ocean before that option was cut from the game even with Raoul gone we can't access this vertebrae but with Raoul gone we can steal canines motivator if we hadn't gotten it ready but since all we need to do to take it freely is talk to the doctor below it's not that hard to do anyway you know I didn't want to miss anything so after Raoul marched off I opened the side door and snuck over to the maintenance wing here we find another side door that we can sneak into to try and over here their conversation Raoul marches right up to Quincy Raoul heard you were talking crap about him again yeah well don't believe everything you hear this has happened once too often asshole Raoul is gonna hurt you a bad this time who told you that because he's next after I knocked some sense into you who are that the two of them fight oh and Raoul is victorious if we walk on over to talk to Quincy can't you see that I'm busy it's busy lying on the ground hurt if we hadn't already we can take the vertebrae plans Quincy doesn't seem to mind but we gotta be quick we gotta make it back to the hanger before Raoul returns after all he told us to guard the vertebrae but once Raoul returns when we try to talk to him he says can't you see that Raoul's busy no time even for a thank you fine with that we've fully explored Navarro we've got a new companion named canine we got the vertebrae plants for the brotherhood of steel but most importantly we discovered the location of the enclave's main base it's in the Pacific Ocean what on a boat now we've got a findaway to activate the taker mord and san francisco to take it to the enclave main base we'll pick up right here where we leave off in my next episode I publish new Fallout videos each
