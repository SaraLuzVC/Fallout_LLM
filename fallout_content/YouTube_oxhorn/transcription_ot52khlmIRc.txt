In our last episode, we finally made it inside Vault City, only to learn that we can't get inside their vault, unless we become a Vault City Citizen. Sure, there's this test we could pass, but the test was made to be impossible. But we do have another option. First Citizen Lynette told us that if we deal with the Gecko situation, we can become a Vault City Citizen. She told us that the residents of Gecko somehow got a pre-war nuclear reactor working, but the nuclear reactor is poisoning and irradiating the drinking water of Vault City. We need to fix the problem. And then Captain Stark asked us to scout out the eight sectors all around Gecko, as he doesn't have the resources to scout them out himself. And so we had Northeast towards Gecko. We'll start with Captain Stark's task, traveling in a counter-clockwise circle, we make it all the way around Gecko, but just as we're about to head back to Vault City. Chose him. The spirits of our ancestors guide me to a world of dreams that I may touch thoughts. Our village suffers without the holy Geck. Your hands hold our lives as a father holds his children. Hakunin reaches out to us with magic. The town is suffering. Every moment we waste makes it that much less likely that we'll get the Geck for the city. We've got to hurry up, so heading back to Vault City. We can head to the Upper City, enter the corrections center, and tell the good news to Stark. You're back again, he says. You lost or do you need something? We can tell him that we surveyed the area around Gecko. And he says good job. He then downloads the information onto his Pipboy, and he logs it into the patrol computers. This intelligence looks good, he says. Well done. Here's your payment $300. But then he offers us a new job. I need someone to travel to NCR. Lately I've been hearing reports that the Republic might be building up military strength. True or not, I need someone to plot around to NCR and report back. When we confirm these instructions, just travel to NCR and then come back, he says yeah that's all I need. I'm more interested in the route to get to NCR than the Republic itself. But I'll still need you to enter the city once you get there. Alright so we've got a new task. Track down the NCR, but let's stay focused here. We still gotta fix the situation at Gecko. So heading to Gecko, we arrive in the middle of town. Just outside we see a sign. Keep out. Warning radiation. We see a number of shacks around us. We'll start with the closest one to the entrance. Heading inside, we see someone whose skin has been very badly burnt. And we sadly can't talk to these guys. They just have random town's folk dialogue. Stay away from Vault City. Those guys are A-holes. And they don't seem to mind if we take all their stuff. We can open the locker in the back of the room. Here we find some new cacola, some rope in a bag. And we can open his dresser where we find two Gecko belts. When done we can move out to explore the next house. Here we find a bit of a farm with more ghouls farming. Entering the farmhouse, we find it empty. There's some right away in the desk, some flares and money in the bookshelf. That's it for the farmhouse. Heading north we can inspect this outhouse. We find that it's occupied. Be nice while you're in town, says the guy. And then we can move into the large building. This is a bar called the Harp. The patrons are all musical. Let's sing a song they say. What are you two good to drink with this? And then we can talk to the barkeep. I'm who's he says what do you want? Booz-woz we can say. You want a drink? Well I've got our very own gamma gulp beer at five dollars a bottle and for special occasions our rentgen rum at twelve dollars a bottle. A rentgen is a unit of ionizing radiation. It's named after William Conrad rentgen who discovered the x-ray. Yeah I had to look that up so I could pronounce it. But we're feeling hospitable so we can say I want to buy a round of your fabulous gamma gulp beer for everyone here. It'll cost us thirty five bucks but we can say cost is no object my good man. I'd like a round of drinks for everyone here wooz and with that we buy everyone around. This beer is great. You're okay in my book they say. Heading back to wooz we can try to talk to him. The patrons kept telling us to ask wooz to tell us a story. When we ask him if he tells us a story he says oh I've got this great story. It's really funny. You see there's this head right and the chosen one can say ahead and wooz says yeah it's a head but it's not attached to a body. You see it's been severed. The chosen one can say a severed head I see and this becomes entertaining when and wooz says just hold on a moment. This severed head you see it's in hell and it flies around there you know in hell and it runs into all kinds of famous people there and the chosen one can say wait a severed head is in hell and it flies around doing what? Well it's doing stuff says wooz you know it's got things that it wants to do or maybe things it's forced to do. The point is it's doing stuff you know there in hell oh god I just can't stand it and the chosen one can interject you kind of obsess about this don't you? Were you in your mother close? Did you ever have problems with bed wetting? And wooz says no you just don't understand it's all about a severed head get it? It's funny how can you think about a severed head in hell of all places and not laugh? At this point the chosen one is at his wit's end but so was not to alienate this guy we can say oh I see why yes of course that's very funny I just can't contain my amusement but enough enjoyment oh my splitting sides I need to ask you something see he says I told you it was funny is there anything else you need? We can play tragic the garnering with him and he says are you dumb? He says that tragic the garnering is the most habit-forming thing since jet and we can say what's jet and he says jets a chem that comes from new Reno were you born yesterday or are you just dumb? You really like calling people dumb? We can then ask him to tell us more about tragic the garnering and he says well tragic the garnering isn't just a game it's an obsession not a clone either some think that the way it changes a person's life is tragic but they just don't understand it's wonderful he says you should play just once the first box of cards is free a little something from me to you and we can say thanks hey these look great we tear the wrapping of the packet cards and the chosen one says mmm I just love that smell he says now that you're one of us would you like to play a game we can say sure but he has to show us how and who says it's simple really even someone dumb can understand it first you build a play deck out of cards that you have and then you but then the chosen one interrupts him aha you say you deal to the third player unless it's Thursday okay I think I've got it now let's play with that we play a game and who says I won screw you you're dumb I have crushed you now I can build an even better deck with your cards well that was exhausting but we're not done we can then ask who's to tell us about the place and he says well there's not much to tell really just a bunch of ghouls clinging tenaciously to the ass end of life he says the name of this bar is harp named after a favorite hangout that he used to have before the war he sees it as a reminder of time's past we can say before the war that was a long time ago and we learned that he was alive before the war he says it sure was a long time ago how do you think ghouls are made you think some of us just get up one day and say to ourselves gee I wonder what it would be like to have my flesh rotting off of my body and we can say well then how do you make a ghoul and he says with silver bells and cuckles shells and boy you are dumb aren't you severe radiation that's how how do you think you know many bombs go boom flash of light and heat flesh burns off but you don't quite die type severe radiation screw you very much for bringing back all those intensely painful memories asshole we're a town of leftovers slightly overcooked leftovers and this guy's a cheery fellow and the chosen one can be sarcastic I prefer medium rare myself we can say but that pretty much exhausts our conversation options with woos if we try to barter with him all we find is a deck of tragic the garnering guards guy really loves his cards with that we can leave the harp thank god and move across the street to the manager's office inside the manager's office we find herald hello there smooth skin the name's herald I help keep this town running smooth skin why did you call me that you cut with the dull edge of the knife don't you you don't look like an orange peole left in the sun hold hey your skin still soft and purty you just better not be getting any funny ideas about my soft skin funny ideas oh you mean like skin in your life with a rusty dull knife and then graft in your still warm wet glisten oh so soft skin over my crusty rotten guk uh yeah that's exactly what I meant good call well you don't have anything to worry about can't find my knife well that's good hey herald what you do here whatever it takes to keep this place together better job on it than me this place is coming apart well sort of our atomic reactors amine sensitive the people I got running it mean well but oh well they are not the sharpest tools in the shed if you know what I mean now what do you mean need a little time on the wetstone yourself I mean they are not too bright here's an example the other day I get a report on it it says the main coolant valve should be shut down that would have caused a meltdown that would make the grand canyon look like a pig wall oh that sounds bad oh yeah that would be bad now I got things fixed up in time but we came close to the end there who's you they need someone to watch out for well good thing you're here to help them then who do you think I'd be making things right although if we don't get a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator pretty damn quick here is gonna be trouble well what the hell is a hydro magnet whatever later oh well technically it's a thingy okay what's a do without a functional hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator we early can radioactive coolant into the groundwater now that means anyone using that water is not gonna need an eye light to take a midnight piss also we need more fuel because our power plant is not burning it very efficiently I see so they're accidentally irradiating the groundwater well maybe we can do something to help sounds bad Harold where would she go to get a hydro magnet is something or other well I'm certain those ordinary bastards in vault city have one not that they'd share hell even if we had one of those thingies I'm not so certain festers could install the dang thing wait vault city has one and they wouldn't give you the part even if it means that the groundwater won't be polluted anymore well they'd only help us if they thought it was in their own best interest to do so not much chance of that happening well you might be right still if someone could convince them that they should help you they shoot ghouls on side makes conversation a bit tricky well I wonder if someone else could tell them we need a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator and it needs to be installed soon or we have got some real problems what happens if you don't get the part if we don't get it you can bet those bones from vault city will shut down our power plant permanently what will you do then take dirt naps vault city doesn't play nice they'll just come up here and kill all of us if we don't get that part well at least I have a tree for a monument yeah about that is that a tree growing out of your head jealous his name's Herbert I talked to him when I get lonely he just getting his name's Bob who do you buy your fuel from we get our fuel from the broken hills that's a mining community south you must know if there's something called a garden of Eden creation kit here right garden of Eden creation kit again right I seem to remember vaults had those don't know where you'd find one today is there someplace I can resupply here well am I right talking a ooze over in the harp you can't miss it just across the way yeah been there had that lovely conversation thanks Harold sound looks like Harold needs a thermo hydraulic something orator and that'll solve the problems for both cities vault city no longer has radiated water gecko is no longer in danger of being wiped out by vault city but before we head back to vault city to see if we can find one of the something others we can finish exploring gecko the bathroom near to Harold's shack is empty head north we find another ghoul home the containers are all empty except for the bookshelf in the bedroom they refine some boxed foods and some jerky when done we can take the exit grid to the north to inspect the northern side of town we see a shack directly in front of us it's a survival slash gear locker the guy inside is nice enough hello there he says Percy Crump here master merchant miss low-calody but you can call me playing old Percy yes you can heck everybody does now what can I do for you when we ask him for town gossip he says that there's not a lot going on in town he heard woos ropt some newbie out of a black orchard the other day he he he he he okay so I guess a black orchard is some sort of tragic the garnering card any house tother than that my friend woody's done gone missing we can ask him to tell us about woody gone missing and he says well you see I had a friend named old woody that woody he can sleep like nobody I ever did see what's worse he likes to travel really likes to kick up the dust that one does that ain't so much of a problem he says around here that is but last I heard woody was gonna take a stroll over to the den you know where the den is and we say yeah we know where the den is go on and he says well any house like I've been saying that it's so much of a problem around gecko but you see people in other parts ain't so used to the way we look so we can say and he says can't you put two and two together I'm worried that woody might have taken himself a nap in the den it's a long trip after all and then they would have buried the pork us alive I need someone to go look from there and we can say and he says well I miss him that's why per se then blinks moistly at us nothing like a moist blink oh I see he says you want to know what's in it for you and we can say yeah this is usually the part where I get more interested tell on and he says well I know where I can get a hold of a heck of a lot of pre-war stocka genuine radix and radaway don't do me no good no how but I figured that ought to be worth something to a smoothie like you you're gonna take the job for me or not I'll only pay you off if I know woody is safe just how much is the heck of a lot we can say and he says it's a darn sight more than you'll ever need that's how much it is you're gonna do it now we know exactly where woody is we met him during my episode on the den though we didn't realize his name was woody at the and if we are interested in a heck of a lot of radix and radaway we can say yes I'll do it I'll get back to you soon in the meantime we can peruse his goods he has a decent stock a 14 millimeter pistol and a whole bunch of 10 millimeter shotgun and 14 millimeter ammunition he has around 840 caps to barter with an a stack of about six simpax if we expect the locker in the back of his shack we find a yellow key card and another box of food before we head off to the den we can explore the shack to the right here we find a few towns folk wanderin around and in the bookshelf we find a book of first aid continuing north we arrive in some sort of junkyard there's a garage to the left inside we find the scrap of a car but it's ruined it can't be repaired move in north we pass a junkyard dog a big rusty truck and a tiny little shack it's another outhouse and it's empty so move and right we find an L shaped farmhouse the two rooms to the left and below are empty but going around back behind the building we find a door to the top room and here we find a ladder leading below ground heading down we find the entrance to an underground bunker or perhaps it's an abandoned portion of the pre-war Poseidon energy reactor passing through the doors we find a bunch of ghoul guards join us and renew they shout continuing to the right we find a path south a doorway to the right and then a path north heading north first a guard says his sleekness wishes to see you okay we'll keep an eye out for his sleekness but this passageway is empty so retracing our steps we can open the door to the right a guard says smooth skins may renew to okay good to know but this path is also empty so retracing our steps and heading south we pass through another door you too can renew says the ghoul guard okay we'll bear that in mind continuing south with the door we finally find someone who has something to say we see a larger than average ghoul renew comrade i am zomak some call me zomak the destroyer what is your business here okay zomak the destroyer i'm just looking around we can say and he says you should look somewhere else or zomak will show you the stars so instead we can say oh oh i uh i wish to renew and he says then you must see him him we can say where is him i mean he and he says he is the granter of enlightenment it is he that promises renewal to all who follow him and we can say well i'm just about to for some renewal where is he and zomak the destroyer says well he's right back hey just who are you anyway to get past this guy without turning him hostile we can say oh don't worry about it it'll be okay i just have to ask him a couple of questions and he says well in that case come on in he's right in the next room don't keep him waiting so heading through the door we can turn right or left all we find to the right are more ghoul guards but if we turn to the left we find a mole rat we find him musing to himself so many things pass away times are not what they were and then he sighs i feel that my soul remaining kin has died mad though he was i wish it were not so i had hoped that he might find some happiness even in his dotage and he's referring to the rat god the rat god that we killed in my episode on the town of Klamath he and his rats had infested trapper town and we had to kill him to clear them out but this guy seems to be a bit more intelligent for a talking rat person and he says well enough of my sad musings are you ready to become one of us you mean to become a giant rat we can say and he says you humans have such limited tolerances i would have remained a normal rat if you humans hadn't done your best to destroy the world if it were for the radiation i wouldn't be what i am today and what's that exactly we can say i was just one of many normal rats in an advanced research lab then one day there were explosions our cages were broken open and we were doused with some sort of fluid from a huge vat then what we can say and he says i crawled outside as i began to heal i noticed that i had changed i tried to communicate with people but they all just tried to kill me humans are just too violent to survive under their own leadership but that's another story the first step is to repair the reactor repair the reactor we can say and he says yes you must get a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator from vault city in order to repair the gecko reactor if you don't then vault city will no doubt attack gecko of course by destroying the reactor they will doom themselves in the long run as well doom themselves we can say how do you mean in order to survive he says both gecko and vault city will need to cooperate vault city needs the power from the atomic reactor in order to expand and we need vault city's medical technology unless we cooperate both cities will stagnate vault city needs to help us to repair our power plant how are you going to get them to do that we can ask our atomic reactor needs a part if we have any hope of getting it to run efficiently what kind of part we can ask and he says a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator that's the part that you need to get from vault city then you need to bring it back here and get it installed in the reactor how do I do that we can say and he says well once you have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator from vault city bring it back to the reactor then you can try to convince that pump a slug festus to install the part or use the repair robot to install the part or you could even try to install the part yourself of course so long as somebody does it we'll be all right we can ask this guy since he seems so wise how do I get the part from vault city and he says you have to show them that it's in their own best interest to do so people are easily manipulated through self-interest and the chosen one can say look i don't think the people in vault city will give me a part for your atomic power plant and the talking mole rat says they'll give you the hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator if you can prove that doing so benefits vault city i have prepared an economic report that details just how much preparing our power plant benefits vault city i'll let our comrades here in gecko know of your mission that's great we can say but who in vault city would even think of reading such a thing and he says i think that mcclure is the only council member in vault city with enough brains to see past his prejudices he'll make sure you get what you need and we can say okay i guess it's worth a shot where do i get this disc and he says you need to go up above to the junkyard look for a ghoul named Gordon he has the economic data disk that you need you'll have my talisman so he'll know to give you the disk what talisman we can say and he says the ock is a symbol of life once i give you this talisman you'll be one of us and your comrades will be more likely to help you along the path towards renewal but be careful who you show it to renewal we can ask what do you mean and he says well as part of my plan to rule the world i intend to reward my ghoul followers by finding a way to restore their humanity how are you gonna do that we can say and he says when i unite gecko in vault city under my rulership i will dedicate vault city's medical labs to finding a way to reverse the effects of radiation that turned the people into ghouls they will be renewed reborn as humans once again that doesn't sound so bad we can say at this point we can reject the talisman but to continue we can say okay i'll take your onc talisman and the talking ballrat says now you're one of us soon i will take over the world and all of you will be renewed we could kill him at this point because he's a creepy talking ballrat or we can live and let live and say whatever i guess i better get going on that atomic powerplant thing and with that um we finish our audience with an unusually large ballrat at any rate we've got the ock let's see if we can find a use for it inspecting it in our inventory it says this is a talisman which is worn by the followers of the brain oh really we just found a ballrat who wants to tick over the world and his name is the brain okay 90s kids will remember now if only we can find pinky heading back topside we can move east moving east we find a number of shacks we'll start by heading into this smaller one to the north inside we find a man not a ghoul the game describes him as a very glum looking human hello there he says ever notice that each Brahman has its own personality well if you watch them as long as i have you sure notice that's really interesting we can say who are you and he says well my real name's john but everyone around here calls me lumpy why lumpy we can ask and he says well it's sort of a joke you see they usually call people like you and me smooth skins but i was treated so poorly by other smooth skins down in vault city that everyone here figured i must be more lumpy than they are sound logic why were you treated so poorly in vault city we can ask and he says well they said i wasn't human enough for them i'm sort of radiation resistant perfect for here but they didn't like it treated me like dirt really we can ask and he says yeah really one day i just couldn't take it anymore i figured that dying out in the wastes was better than living with those assholes in vault city how gendered up here then we can ask and he says will a caravan from broken hills found me and brought me here i've been here ever since one thing about the ghouls here is that they care more about what kind of person you are inside it's like a big family after learning more about lumpy here we can ask him about all that junk in the junkyard and he says well some of the junk is left over from when they were building the reactor before the war but the rest of the stuff i just don't know skater collects all kinds of stuff when we ask him about skater he says well skaters sort of a mechanic he'll take apart almost anything that you bring him gets most of them back together too soon or later sometimes things just end up working better than they did before where can we find skater we can ask and he says well he's right here just open your eyes and look around a bit sheesh oh great thanks lumpy when we ask him about any town gossip he says well mostly i just stick to my business but sometimes i think i hear things late at night hear things we can ask like what and he says well i'm not sure mind you but i think i've heard people at least i thought it was people coming and going from the reactor pit late at night people we can say every night and he says well i don't know if they were people or what but usually it's just every couple of nights noises coming and going from the reactor pit i don't know what's going on and i don't want to know either we can say you hear voices too i always figure the voices are just inside my head and lumpy looks closely into our eyes you hear voices inside your head do they tell you how much better you are than everyone else do they tell you that someday people will kneel before your greatness and he smiles and nods we can say uh yeah sure i do doesn't everyone and he says i kind of had you pick for that type when i first saw you but i wasn't sure get out of here you have friggin that case and the chosen one can say well one of us is a nutcase i just think you're confused as to which one of us it is despite this exchange we can't barter with him but all he has is booze some rattle way and a small amount of money so now we need to find this skater guy heading to the building to the south we find a bit of a storage shed there's a dean's electronics on one of the shelves and a lock picking kit in a locker heading into the next room we find the proprietor of the shop skater wearing old greased stained clothing but instead of greeting us with pleasantries he quickly examines our bag i see that you've got a mighty fine toolkit there snap off ain't it i'll trade you this fuel cell controller for it he says oh well that was handy we got this snap off toolkit from vix daughter valori at vault city and a fuel cell controller is the final part smiddy from the den told us that he needed to get the highway man working that was parked just outside his workshop so that we can have our own functional car sounds good it's a deal we can say and he says that's a mighty fine trade you should be able to just plug that sucker in and get your car a working you know i could do you another favor by fixing up some of your stuff for free too really we can say for free huh what do i need to do for you and he says well you see i need a darn three step plasma transformer and the only place i can figure to get one is from the supply room well why don't you just go get it from there then we can say and he says i kind of wore out my welcome there and it was only a little fire too could have happened to anyone anyhow they won't let me anywhere inside the reactor building now i need someone else to go get my part for me and we can ask how do i get this plasma transformer for you and he says you has got to get yourself a supply requisition form once you have that just give it to Jeremy in the supply room and he'll give you any darn thing you want you can get supply requisition forms from herald or festus herald is in the settlement as we know we've met him already and festus he says is in the reactor control room but we might have to kind of get the forms on the slide if you know what i mean he says you mean i have to steal the requisition form don't you we can say and he says well or yeah i guess so you might ask them but i wouldn't put your chances too high there well we can say i'll see what i can find out quite a handy little ghoul indeed i like the idea of him upgrading our weapons so it looks like we need to go find a plasma transformer for him and to do that we'll have to go into the reactor before we do we can open a door to his workshop to the right we see a bunch of scrap on some tables we can walk away with a crowbar and a sludge hammer with the machine shop explored we can move to the shack to the right we see another ghoul he appears to be preoccupied this is Gordon the ghoul that the brain told us about the man we're supposed to present the onk talisman to i see you have the symbol are you here for the information he says the symbol we can ask and he says you wear the symbol of renewal you are one of us renew comrade renew oh yes i am one of us reno renew and he says did he send you for the data disk and we can say yes of course i'm here for the disk hand it over right now here it is he says but don't let the wrong person know that you have it give it only to councilman mcclure in vault city and we can say yes of course uh renew brother we now have the data disk which should be exactly what we need to get the part from vault city that we need to fix the reactor inside this guy's locker we find a carton of cheesy poofs i love cheesy poofs and then we can inspect the gecko holo disk in our inventory the label on this holo tape reads gecko economic data it's difficult to interpret most of the technical charts tables and formulae here but the majority of the information seems to highlight the advantages of a vault city slash gecko alliance perfect exactly what we need now heading north into the reactor we see that this section of the beside an energy reactor was under construction when the bomb dropped it wasn't finished we see a big gaping hole but nothing inside so heading out we can begin to tackle some of our tasks we'll start by heading to vault city and showing this holo tape to mcclure we were told to only show this to mcclure but we can check in with first citizen lanette to see exactly what she would say about it yes what is it i found out that all they need to get their plant running clean is a hydroelectric mechanitose for your regulator so you haven't taken care of the problem uh as i understand it you have the part here in vault city to fix their plant what if we do that is only a temporary solution please fix the problem not their power plant am i making myself clear first citizen i mean no disrespect but there's a way to solve your problem without killing the ghouls or shutting down their reactor now if we could just get the part i've had enough of your foolishness you are no longer permitted inside vault city my guards will escort you to the front gate and with that we either have to fight them or we're banished from the city so instead of talking with this cheery individual we'll go straight to council member mcclure we met him in our last episode and we find him right where we left him yes he says was there something else you wanted we can say i think you might have a part that could fix gecko's power plant and he says what do you mean and we can explain it to him if i had a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator i could make their plant run clean and he says well that's an acceptable solution stopping the radiation poisoning is all i care about we can say yeah but look i'm worried that lanette will withhold my citizenship if i fix the plant and he can say if you fix their plant i'll give you citizenship and there's not a damn thing she can do about it excellent we can say where can i get the part and he says go see randall the chief amenities officer he should have the part in stock and we can say there's one more thing you might find this economic data disk interesting and he says i'm sorry an economic data disk what do you mean and we can say it's an economic data disk that shows the amount of energy that gecko's atomic power plant produced before the war and could produce again muclora says i see so what does this have to do with me and we can say well as i understand it bald city's power generator can only support so many people in fact it's already nearing its limit and he says i'm not going to ask you how you came by that information but if it were true what are you proposing and we can say once the gecko power plant is fixed the disk indicates it's possible it could produce enough energy for vault city too it looks like the reactor would need to be optimized first though and he says are you suggesting we seize gecko and take the power plant i will not list no no no no we can say if gecko could receive the optimization data for their plant i'm betting they would be willing to trade their excess power for medical assistance and muclora says hmm as far as medical assistance goes i'm not unsympathetic to the plant of the ghouls they have certainly suffered enough but how could we optimize their plant and we can say i don't know maybe there's someone i can talk to once the plant is repaired and muclora says i have no objections to your proposal if you can find some means of optimizing the plant then let me know and we can say all right i'll go get that part from Randall and see about repairing the reactor first and muclora says i'll keep the economic data and study it some more perhaps i can persuade the council to enter negotiations with gecko to trade for their power the data disk would be a strong argument in of itself all right so we're certainly setting up a situation here that benefits both parties but we have a lot of work to do heading south we can go through the exit grid and then head to the amenities office here we find Randall we can say councilor muclora said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that i could have and he says yeah he said you'd be stopping by oxhorn right wait one minute i'll go get you the hydroelectric magneto uh the high mag all right we can say and he comes back a moment later okay here you go one high mag kind of looks like a lava lamp doesn't it oh don't drop it it's pretty fragile we now have exactly what we need to repair the plant but before we head back to gecko we can take care of some of our gecko side quests we'll start by heading west towards the den then going to the west side of town we can pay a visit to the great aninus we met and chatted with him during my video on the den that you can watch here and in that video we were called peaking into his sarcophagus where he showed us a janeu wine Egyptian mummy but now we realize that it wasn't a mummy in fact it looked like a sleeping ghoul and now that we know that woody has gone missing from gecko the pieces fall into place woody went to the den where he promptly fell asleep the great aninus thought he was a mummy and put him on display so after going through the great aninus's presentation he opens the lid and we see woody the chosen one can say hey wait a minute that's not a mummy that's a ghoul woody hey woody is that you and the mummy snorts stretches languidly and then looks at us with a sleepy blink in his eyes hello he says sleepily holy crap that is woody we can say run woody run for it well uh gimp for it then go woody go and we learned that woody for it is in fact woody not a mummy who stands somewhat drowsily before us grabs the sides of the paper mishays sarcophagus lets out a shriek and runs for the door leaving a trail of toilet paper mummy wrappings and hasty think he kindly stranger behind him and then we can gloat to the great aninus ha I knew it you're finished in this town you're not the great aninus anymore you're just another rass but the great aninus shrugs I knew I should have picked up that monohedded brahman instead oh well back to the drawing board a monohedded brahman we can say sure who would ever believe that goodbye you charlatan and with that we rescue woody now we need to go back to gecko to get our reward for saving woody but we have one more task to complete in this town heading to the far western section of the town we can head into the junkyard to talk with smitty first we can give him the fuel cell controller that we got in gecko then we can give him the fuel cell regulator that we got in climath and once we give him both he says you have both is that right well here's the deal you give me two thousand dollars and I'll sell you the car heck I'll leave it and install the fuel cell controller for you should run as good as new I'll even charge it up with some extra micro fusion power cells that I've got if we have the money we can say that sounds good to me here's the money and all the parts the screen fades to black and smitty says just take it easy with her tells you warms up now and we can say all right I will thanks smitty and we now have our very own working car we just open up the driver side door and bingo look at that we can drive anywhere we want to on the world map but I'm afraid I'm all out of time in our next episode we'll drive our car back to gecko and do our best to fix and optimize the power plant hopefully then mcclure will give us our citizenship so we can finally read the terminals inside the vault city vault then we can continue our quest to find a gecko for a rollo before it's too late if you don't want
